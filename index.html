            <p>Here are some fun facts about Harry Potter:</p>
            <ul id="facts2">
                <li>Harry's parents James and Lily are soulmates because the patronus charm (to ward off Dementors) is a physical representation of one’s soul.</li>
                <li>Dumbledore is an Old English word for “bumblebee."</li>
                <li>If Muggles stumbled across Hogwarts, it would look like a dilapidated building with a “Keep Out: Dangerous” sign on it.</li>
                <li>Rowling has said that if Voldemort saw a boggart it would embody his own corpse, since death was always his greatest fear.</li>
            </ul>
